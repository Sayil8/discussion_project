This project consists of various microservices which work together to build a complex web app. This is better know as microservices architecture. You can find all the information regarding Microservices architecture in this book: 

The application is divided into services which allows the application to grow horizontally more easily. 

The services where developed with different approaches to try explore the advantages which they provide. Although they have different approaches, they also have similarities. All where developed with php and the symfony framework. All of them use Doctrine and MySQL for the database management.
Each microservice has its own readme file which tries to explain in detail the functionality of them.
